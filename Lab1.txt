3. A piece of wire is to be bent in the form of a rectangle to put around a picture frame. The length
of the picture frame is 1.5 times the width. If you are given the length of the wire to be 10
inches, calculate the length and width of the rectangle. Please solve the problem using Math,
and step by step instructions on how you did it. The instructions should be in steps and not a
paragraph. Mention all assumptions you may make, write down all the formula you used for the
calculation and give your solution at the end with the right units. If you do not follow all the
steps, and write all the details, you will not get full credit. (25 points)

2W + 2L = 10

1.5w = L

2W + (2*(1.5W)) = 10

3w = 10

5W = 10

W = 2

4 + 2L = 10

2L = 6

L = 3

4. A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted.
Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 square feet. The length and width of the door is
9ft by 3.5ft. The length and width of the windows are 4ft by 3ft. The length and width of the
book shelf is 9ft by 4 ft. The length, width, and height of the room is 20ft by 25ft by 20ft.
Calculate and output the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room. Please solve
the problem using Math, and step by step instructions on how you did it. The instructions
should be in steps and not a paragraph. Mention all assumptions you may make, write down all
the formula you used for the calculation and give your solution at the end with the right units. If
you do not follow all the steps, and write all the details, you will not get full credit. (25 points)

assuming that you are painting behind the book case you need 15 Gallons of paint
size of room that needs to be painted

2(20*20)+2(20*25)
	800+1000 =1800 sqft
window and door sizes
Door = 9 X 3.5= 31.5
Windows = 2(4x3) = 24

	1800-31.5-24 = 1744.5/120 = 14.5375

you will need 15 gallons of paint
