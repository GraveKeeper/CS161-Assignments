You are given a list of students’ names and their test scores. Design an algorithm
that does the following: 

a.Calculates the average test scores.

b. Determines and prints the names of all the students whose test scores are
below the average test score.

c. Determines the highest test score.

d. Prints the names of all the students whose test scores are the same as the
highest test score

	ask for input promt for how many students

	ask for input of student test grades

	 take number/names of students and test grades and devide by number of students

	set the highest score = to the first score then compare each incoming score to the highet score if score=higher then revious score
then make the new score the highest.

	if = to highestscore print studentname and student score.
	
The dealer’s cost of a car is 85% of the listed price. The dealer would accept any
offer that is at least $500 over the dealer’s cost. Design an algorithm that prompts
the user to input the list price of the car and print the least amount that the dealer
would accept for the car.


	tell the user to input the cost of the car

	take input
	
	take input and * by the % cost of the car then add 500

	formula == (input*85) + 500 

	print the min amount that would be payed for the car

	end program;
