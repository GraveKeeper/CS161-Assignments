1) Evaluate the following:
a) 28 - 3 + 6
31

b) 32 % 12 + 6 - 36 / 5 * 8
-42

c) 4 – 6 % 11
-2

d) 18.0 + 5.0 * 3.0 / 4.0
21.75

2) If int x = 3; int y = 18; double z = 9.5; and double w = 3.5; 
evaluate each of the following statements,
if possible. If it is not possible, state the reason.
a) (?? + ??) % ??
(3+18)%18
=3

b) ?? % ?? – ??
-0.5

c) ?? % (?? + ??)
6.5

d) (?? + ??) / ??
7.857142

3) Which of the following variable declarations are correct? If a variable declaration is not correct, give
the reason and provide the correct variable declaration.

a) double conversion = 2.5;
correct
b) char grade = ‘B+’;
incorrect character variables only store one variable and it needs a string
string grade = ‘B+’;
c) double 28.5 = num;
incorrect it should be double num = 28.5

d) string message = ‘ ‘ First C++ course’;
correct

e) int age = 18 years;
incorrect int can only hold a whole number value

f) float x, y, decimal;
correct 


4) Suppose x, y, z, and w are int variables. What value is assigned to each of these variables after the
last statement executes?
x = 4; y = 11;
z = y - 2 * x;
x = z + y;
y = x + 5 * z;
w = x - y + 2 * z;
x = y + w - x;

w = -9
x = 6
y = 29
z = 3


5) Suppose x, y, and z are int variables and w and t are double variables. What value is assigned to
each of these variables after the last statement executes?
x = 23;
y = 35;
x = ?? + ?? / 4 - 3;
z = ?? % 3;
w = 28 / 3 + 6.5 * 2;
t = ?? / 4.0 + 15 % 4 - 3.5;

t = 6.5
w = 22
x = 28
y = 35
z = 1

6) Write C++ statements that accomplish the following:

a) Output the newline character.
cout << '\n';
or
cout << endl; 
b) Output the tab character.
cout << "/t" << endl;
c) Output double quotation mark.
cout << "\"\"" << endl;



7) Give meaningful identifiers for the following variables:
a) A variable to store the first name of a student.
stname

b) A variable to store the discounted price of an item.
discount

c) A variable to store the number of juice bottles.
Jb

d) A variable to store the number of miles traveled.
mtravel

e) A variable to store the highest test score.
hscore



8) Write C++ statements to do the following:

a) Declare int variable num1 and num2
int num1,num2;
b) Prompt the user to input two numbers.
cout << " please enter 2 numbers " << endl;

c) Input the first number in num1 and the second number in num2
cin >> num1;
cin >> num2; 

d) Output num1, num2, and 2 times num1 minus num2. Your output must
identify each number and the expression.
cout << "you inputs were " << num1 << " " << num2 << " " << endl;
cout << " this is what your first and second number equal "<< 2*num1 - num2 << endl;

9) Suppose a, b, and c are int variables and a = 5 and b = 6. 
What value is assigned to each variable after each statement executes?
 If a variable is undefined at a particular statement, report UND (undefined).
a b c
a = (b++) + 3;
a=9 b=7 c=und
c = 2 * a + (++b);
a=9 b=8 c=26
b = 2 * (++c) - (a++);
a=10 b=45 c=27

10) What is printed by the following program? Suppose the input is:
Miller
34
340

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
const int PRIME_NUM = 11;
int main()
{
const int SECRET = 17;
string name;
int id;
int num;
int mysteryNum;
cout << "Enter last name: ";
cin >> name;
cout << endl;
cout << "Enter a two digit number: ";
cin >> num;
cout << endl;
id = 100 * num + SECRET;
cout << "Enter a positive integer less than 1000: ";
cin >> num;
cout << endl;
mysteryNum = num * PRIME_NUM - 3 * SECRET;
cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
cout << "Id: " << id << endl;
cout << "Mystery number: " << mysteryNum << endl;
return 0;
}

The Program outputs:
Name: Miller
Id: 3417
Mystery number: 3689
